#' Get System of Equations Weights
#'
#' Calculates dynamic weights for a system of equations and updates the
#' identities with these weights. The function processes a list of time
#' series data (`ts_data`), a list of identities (`identities`), and a set of
#' dates (`dates`) to compute and update weights dynamically.
#'
#' @param ts_data A named list of `stats::ts` objects. This list should contain
#' the time series data for both the aggregate values and their components.
#' @param identities A named list of identities, each containing components
#' and their respective weights. The list should include elements with
#' "lhs_weight" in their names.
#' @param dates A list with start and end dates for dynamic weight calculations.
#' The dates list should have a sub-list `dynamic_weights` with `start` and
#' `end` entries, each being a numeric representation of a date, it should be
#' in the format produced by `dates_to_num`.
#'
#' @return The function updates the `identities` list with the calculated
#' dynamic weights and returns nothing explicitly.

#' Calculate Dynamic Weights for Identity Equations
#'
#' Computes the weights required for identity equations using time series data.
#' The weights represent how components collectively sum up to or are related to
#' an aggregate value over the specified time period.
#'
#' @param ts_data A named list of `stats::ts` objects. It should contain the
#' time series data for both the aggregate value and its components. Ensure that
#' `ts_data` contains the time series listed in `iden`.
#' @param start A numeric value representing the start date for the time series
#' data subset. This value should be in the numeric format used by the function
#' `dates_to_num`.
#' @param end A numeric value representing the end date for the time series data
#' subset, in the same numeric format as `start`.
#'
#' @return A list of `stats::ts` objects containing the calculated weights for
#' the given aggregate value and its components. The top-level name of the
#' list is the aggregate value, and its sub-level names correspond to the
