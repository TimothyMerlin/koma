\usage{
initialize_sampler(
  y_matrix,
  x_matrix,
  character_gamma_matrix,
  character_beta_matrix,
  jx
)
}
\arguments{
\item{y_matrix}{A \eqn{(T \times n)} matrix \eqn{Y}, where \eqn{T} is the
number of observations and \eqn{n} the number of equations, i.e. endogenous
variables.}

\item{x_matrix}{A \eqn{(T \times k)} matrix \eqn{X} of observations on
\eqn{k} exogenous variables.}

\item{character_gamma_matrix}{A matrix \eqn{\Gamma} that holds the
coefficients in character form for all equations. The dimensions of the
matrix are \eqn{(T \times n)}, where \eqn{T} is the number of
observations and \eqn{n} the number of equations.}

\item{character_beta_matrix}{A matrix \eqn{\beta} that holds the
coefficients in character form for all equations. The dimensions of the
matrix are \eqn{(k \times n)}, where \eqn{k} is the number of
exogenous variables and \eqn{n} the number of equations.}

\item{jx}{The index of equation \eqn{j}.}
}
\value{
A list containing the initial parameters for gamma
(\code{gamma_parameters_j}) and the Cholesky factor of the
inverse of the Hessian (\code{cholesky_of_inverse_hessian}) if
\code{number_endogenous_in_j} is greater than 0.
If not, only the \code{gamma_parameters_j} parameter is returned as 0.
}
\description{
\code{initialize_sampler} initializes the sampler for the Metropolis Hastings
algorithm. It obtains the initial \eqn{gamma} parameters by numerically
maximizing the target function. It then calculates the Cholesky factor
\eqn{L} of the inverse of the Hessian \eqn{M^{-1}} of the target function.
This Cholesky factor, along with the gamma parameter for equation \eqn{j}, is
returned. The Cholesky factor is used to draw the candidate gamma in the MH
algorithm.
