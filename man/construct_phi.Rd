\title{Construct a Dynamic SEM (Structural Equation Model) Phi Matrix}
\usage{
construct_phi(sys_eq, beta_matrix)
}
\arguments{
\item{sys_eq}{A list containing the system of equations. Must
include \verb{$equations} with the equations of the system,
\verb{$endogenous_variables} with the names of the endogenous variables, and
\verb{$total_exogenous_variables} with the names of all exogenous variables.}

\item{beta_matrix}{A numeric matrix of beta coefficients corresponding to the
exogenous variables in the system of equations.}
}
\value{
A named list of \eqn{n \times n} matrices, one per lag \eqn{\ell},
where each matrix \eqn{\Phi(\ell)} contains the coefficients on the
\eqn{\ell}-lagged endogenous variables. The list names correspond to lag
orders (as character strings).
}
\description{
This function constructs the list of lagged endogenous coefficient matrices
\eqn{\Phi(1), \ldots, \Phi(L)} from the system of equations and the beta
matrix. It identifies lagged endogenous regressors in each equation and maps
their coefficients into the corresponding \eqn{\Phi(\ell)} matrix in the
dynamic SEM:
\eqn{Y\Gamma = \tilde{X}\tilde{B} + Y_{t-1}\Phi(1) + \cdots + Y_{t-p}\Phi(L) + U.}
