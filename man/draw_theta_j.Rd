\arguments{
\item{y_matrix}{A \eqn{(T \times n)} matrix \eqn{Y}, where \eqn{T} is the
number of observations and \eqn{n} the number of equations, i.e. endogenous
variables.}

\item{x_matrix}{A \eqn{(T \times k)} matrix \eqn{X} of observations on
\eqn{k} exogenous variables.}

\item{character_gamma_matrix}{A matrix \eqn{\Gamma} that holds the
coefficients in character form for all equations. The dimensions of the
matrix are \eqn{(T \times n)}, where \eqn{T} is the number of
observations and \eqn{n} the number of equations.}

\item{character_beta_matrix}{A matrix \eqn{\beta} that holds the
coefficients in character form for all equations. The dimensions of the
matrix are \eqn{(k \times n)}, where \eqn{k} is the number of
exogenous variables and \eqn{n} the number of equations.}

\item{jx}{The index of equation \eqn{j}.}

\item{gamma_parameters_j}{A \eqn{(n_j \times 1)} matrix with the parameters
of the gamma matrix, where \eqn{n_j} is the number of endogenous variables in
equation \eqn{j}.}
