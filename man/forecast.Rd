\usage{
forecast(
  estimates,
  dates,
  ...,
  restrictions = NULL,
  options = list(approximate = FALSE, probs = NULL, fill = list(method = "mean"),
    conditional_innov_method = "projection")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{estimates}{A \code{koma_estimate} object (\code{\link{estimate}}) containing
the estimates for the simultaneous equations model, as well as a list of time
series and a \code{koma_seq} object (\code{\link{system_of_equations}}) that were
used in the estimation.}

\item{dates}{Key-value list for date ranges in various model operations.}

\item{...}{Additional parameters.}

\item{restrictions}{List of model constraints. Default is empty.}

\item{options}{Optional settings for forecasting. Use
\code{list(approximate = FALSE, probs = NULL, fill = list(method = "mean"),
conditional_innov_method = "projection")}.
Elements:
\itemize{
\item \code{approximate}: Logical. If FALSE (default), compute point
forecasts from predictive draws. If TRUE, compute point forecasts from the
mean/median of coefficient draws (fast approximation).
\item \code{probs}: Numeric vector of quantile probabilities. If NULL, no
quantiles are returned.
\item \code{fill$method}: "mean" or "median" used for conditional fill
before forecasting.
\item \code{conditional_innov_method}: Method for drawing conditional
innovations. One of \code{"projection"} (default) or \code{"eigen"}.
}}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{koma_forecast}.

An object of class \code{koma_forecast} is a list containing the following
elements:
\describe{
\item{mean}{Mean point forecasts as a list of time series of class
\code{koma_ts}.}
\item{median}{Median point forecasts as a list of time series of class
\code{koma_ts}.}
\item{quantiles}{A list of quantiles, where each element is named
according to the quantile (e.g., "q_5", "q_50", "q_95"), and contains the
forecasts for that quantile. This element is NULL if \code{quantiles = FALSE}.}
\item{ts_data}{Time-series data set used in forecasting.}
\item{y_matrix}{The Y matrix constructed from the balanced data up to the
current quarter, used for forecasting.}
\item{x_matrix}{The X matrix used for forecasting.}
}
}
\description{
This function produces forecasts for the SEM.
}
\details{
The \code{forecast} function for SEM uses the estimates from the \code{koma_estimate}
object to produce point forecasts and, optionally, quantile forecasts.
When \code{options$approximate} is FALSE (default), point forecasts are
computed from the predictive draws (with quantiles controlled by
\code{options$probs}). When TRUE, point forecasts are computed from the mean
and median of the coefficient draws for faster, approximate results.

The returned \code{koma_forecast} object keeps forecasts as named lists of
\code{koma_ts} (for \code{mean}, \code{median}, and \code{quantiles}) alongside the input data
and matrices used to produce them.

Use the \code{\link[=print.koma_forecast]{print}} method to print a
the forecast results, use the \code{\link[=plot.koma_forecast]{plot}} method,
to visualize the forecasts and prediction intervals.

This function provides the option for parallel computing through
the \code{future::plan()} function.
