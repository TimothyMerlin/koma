\title{Compute Quantiles of Coefficients from Estimations}
\usage{
quantiles_from_estimates(data, include_mean = FALSE, probs = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A list or array. If multi-dimensional, it should be either
2D or 3D.}

\item{include_mean}{Logical. If TRUE, the mean of the coefficients will
also be computed and returned along with the quantiles. Default is FALSE.}

\item{probs}{A numerical vector specifying the probabilities for which
percentiles should be computed. Default is obtained from \code{get_quantiles()}.}
}
\value{
A named list of computed percentiles for each coefficient. The names
are prefixed with "q_" and suffixed with the percentile value multiplied by
100 (e.g., "q_5", "q_50", "q_95"). If \code{include_mean} is TRUE, "q_mean" is
also included in the list.
}
\description{
This function takes the results of an estimation process, typically stored
in a data matrix or array, and computes specified quantiles. It supports
1D, 2D, and 3D data structures and makes necessary adjustments before
calculations. For multi-dimensional data, the function performs the
percentile computation across each column, retaining only the first
column if the data is 3D.
