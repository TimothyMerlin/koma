\title{Calculate Summary Statistics for Estimates}
\usage{
summary_statistics(
  endogenous_variables,
  estimates,
  sys_eq,
  central_tendency = "mean",
  ci_low = 5,
  ci_up = 95
)
}
\arguments{
\item{endogenous_variables}{A character vector of name(s) of the stochastic
endogenous variable to summarize.}

\item{estimates}{A list of estimates for each stochastic endogenous variable.}

\item{sys_eq}{A list containing endogenous and exogenous
variables, character_gamma_matrix, and character_beta_matrix.}

\item{central_tendency}{A character string indicating which central tendency
measure ("mean" or "median") to use for summary statistics. Default is
"mean".}

\item{ci_low}{The lower bound for the confidence interval as a percentile.
Default is 5.}

\item{ci_up}{The upper bound for the confidence interval as a percentile.
Default is 95.}
}
\value{
A list of summary statistics for each endogenous variable.
}
\description{
Computes summary statistics for a specified endogenous variable
within a system of equations. It returns the coefficients and standard
errors of the equation's variables.
