\title{Calculate Out-of-Sample RMSE for a Specified Horizon}
\usage{
model_evaluation(
  sys_eq,
  variables,
  horizon,
  ts_data,
  dates,
  ...,
  evaluate_on_levels = TRUE,
  options = NULL,
  point_forecast = NULL,
  restrictions = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{sys_eq}{A \code{koma_seq} object (\link{system_of_equations}) containing details
about the system of equations used in the model.}

\item{variables}{A character vector of name(s) of the stochastic
endogenous variable for which the forecast error(s) should be calculated. If
NULL it is calculated for all variables.}

\item{horizon}{The forecast horizon in quarters up to which the RMSE should
be calculated.}

\item{ts_data}{time series data set, must include data until end date of
forecasting period.}

\item{dates}{Key-value list for date ranges in various model operations.}

\item{...}{Additional parameters.}

\item{evaluate_on_levels}{Boolean, if TRUE RMSE is calculated on levels if
FALSE on growth rates.}

\item{options}{Optional settings for modifying the Gibbs sampler
specifications for all equations.
See \link[=get_default_gibbs_spec]{Gibbs Sampler Specifications}.}

\item{point_forecast}{A list that contains the following elements:
\itemize{
\item \code{active}: Determines the type of forecast generated.
If TRUE, a point forecast is created. If FALSE, a density forecast is
returned. Default is TRUE.
\item \code{central_tendency}: A character string indicating which
central tendency measure ("mean" or "median") to use for summary statistics.
Default is "mean".
}}

\item{restrictions}{List of model constraints. Default is empty.}
}
\value{
DataFrame containing the RMSE of the selected Variables up to the
desired horizon.
}
\description{
Computes the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of a model for a given prediction
horizon, incrementing the in-sample data by a quarter for each calculation
until the specified horizon equals the end date in the forecast period.
}
\details{
The function initiates the RMSE calculation from \code{dates$forecast$start} and
continues until \code{dates$forecast$start + horizon} equals \code{dates$forecast$end}.
In each iteration, a quarter is added to both the in-sample data and to
\code{dates$forecast$start}.
