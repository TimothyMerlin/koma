\title{Check Identity Equations in Forecast Output}
\usage{
check_identities_add_up(ts_out, identities, tol = 1e-08)
}
\arguments{
\item{ts_out}{A forecast output time-series matrix.}

\item{identities}{A named list of identity definitions produced by
\code{\link[=get_identities]{get_identities()}} and updated by \code{\link[=get_seq_weights]{get_seq_weights()}}.}

\item{tol}{Numeric tolerance for deviations between the identity and its
reconstructed value.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns \code{NULL}.
}
\description{
Recomputes each identity from its component series and weights, then warns if
deviations exceed \code{tol}. Intended as a safeguard against identity drift.
