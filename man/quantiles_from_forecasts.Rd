\title{Calculate Quantiles from Multiple Forecast Matrices}
\usage{
quantiles_from_forecasts(forecasts, freq, probs = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{forecasts}{A list of matrices. Each matrix should represent a forecasts
with the same dimensions (rows and columns) for comparison.}

\item{freq}{The frequency of the data.}

\item{probs}{A numeric vector specifying which quantiles to compute.
Default is c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1).}
}
\value{
A named list of matrices, where each matrix corresponds to an
original matrix in \code{forecasts}. Each output matrix has an additional
dimension corresponding to the computed quantiles, with dimnames
indicating the quantile levels (e.g., "q_25" for the 25th percentile).
}
\description{
This function calculates specified quantiles  for each variable-time
combination across all draws.
