\title{Construct priors for a single equation}
\usage{
construct_priors_j(priors, character_gamma_matrix, character_beta_matrix, jx)
}
\arguments{
\item{priors}{The priors for \eqn{\theta} in equation \eqn{j}.}

\item{character_gamma_matrix}{A matrix \eqn{\Gamma} that holds the
coefficients in character form for all equations. The dimensions of the
matrix are \eqn{(T \times n)}, where \eqn{T} is the number of
observations and \eqn{n} the number of equations.}

\item{character_beta_matrix}{A matrix \eqn{\beta} that holds the
coefficients in character form for all equations. The dimensions of the
matrix are \eqn{(k \times n)}, where \eqn{k} is the number of
exogenous variables and \eqn{n} the number of equations.}

\item{jx}{The index of equation \eqn{j}.}
}
\value{
A list with elements:
\itemize{
\item \code{theta_mean}: prior means for exogenous coefficients and intercept.
\item \code{theta_vcv}: prior variance-covariance matrix for exogenous terms.
\item \code{omega_df}: degrees of freedom for error covariance prior.
\item \code{omega_scale}: scale matrix for error covariance prior.
\item \code{gamma_mean}: prior means for endogenous coefficients (if set).
\item \code{gamma_vcv}: prior variance-covariance for endogenous terms.
}
}
\description{
\code{construct_priors_j} generates prior hyperparameters for equation \code{jx}
based on user-specified priors and the model's coefficient matrices.
